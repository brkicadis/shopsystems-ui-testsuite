  As a guest user
  I want to make a purchase with a Pay Pal
  And to see that transaction was successful

#  Background:
#    Given I initialize shopsystem
#  #    configure payment method in db
#    And I activate "PayPal" payment action "pay" in configuration
## do all actions in shopsystem that lead to choosing payment method
#    And I prepare checkout with purchase sum "100" in shopsystem
#    Then I see "Wirecard PayPal"
### in some shop systems there is a need to press the button
##    And I start the payment
#
#  Scenario: purchase
#    Given I start the payment
#    When  I go through external flow
#    Then I see successful payment
#    And I see "PayPal" transaction type "purchase" in transaction table
